    abstract = "{Motivation: Gene expression microarray experiments can generate
  data sets with multiple missing expression values. Unfortunately,
  many algorithms for gene expression analysis require a complete
  matrix of gene array values as input. For example, methods such as
  hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering are not robust to
  missing data, and may lose effectiveness even with a few missing
  values. Methods for imputing missing data are needed, therefore, to
  minimize the effect of incomplete data sets on analyses, and to
  increase the range of data sets to which these algorithms can be
  applied. In this report, we investigate automated methods for
  estimating missing data.Results: We present a comparative study of several methods for
  the estimation of missing values in gene microarray data. We
  implemented and evaluated three methods: a Singular Value
  Decomposition (SVD) based method (SVDimpute), weighted K-nearest
  neighbors (KNNimpute), and row average. We evaluated the methods
  using a variety of parameter settings and over different real data
  sets, and assessed the robustness of the imputation methods to the
  amount of missing data over the range of 1–20\\% missing values.
  We show that KNNimpute appears to provide a more robust and
  sensitive method for missing value estimation than SVDimpute, and
  both SVDimpute and KNNimpute surpass the commonly used row average
  method (as well as filling missing values with zeros). We report
  results of the comparative experiments and provide recommendations
  and tools for accurate estimation of missing microarray data under a
  variety of conditions.Availability: The software is available at http://smi-web.stanford.edu/projects/helix/pubs/impute/Contact: russ.altman@stanford.edu*To whom correspondence should be
